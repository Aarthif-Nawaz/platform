    Scenario: List all HXL Licenses
        Given that I want to get all "HXL Licenses"
        And that the oauth token is "testadminuser"
        When I request "/hxl/licenses"
        Then the response is JSON
        And the response has a "count" property
        And the type of the "count" property is "numeric"
        And the "count" property equals "9"
        And the response has a "results" property
        Then the guzzle status code should be 200
