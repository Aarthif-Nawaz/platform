# Security as a user

## Security position overview

As an everyday user of technology we would summarise your main concerns as these:

* **Understanding your actions and their consequences as you work with your devices**. The main intention here is to avoid being tricked into revealing valuable information to undesirable third parties, which is what happens with phishing attacks. Phishing is one of the most usual techniques deployed against specific targets.
* **Keeping your devices and applications defences strong**. Sometimes it's not you, sometimes the equipment and software that you use was poorly designed and there were gaps left for attackers to find their way in. However, equipment and software can be made better and more reliable, and that is something you can do.  
* **Containing the impact of any successful breach**. Unfortunately, in some occasions, the bad guys win. However, there are things you can do to limit how a breach affects you and keeping the bad guys from winning even more.

All the advices and techniques shown here will revolve around in some way around these three aspects.

### The address bar is key

### When in doubt, research
