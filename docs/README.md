## What is Ushahidi?

Ushahidi is an open source web application for information collection, visualization and interactive mapping. It helps you to collect info from: SMS, Twitter, RSS feeds, Email. It helps you to process that information, categorize it, geo-locate it and publish it on a map.

## A note for grassroots organizations
If you are starting a deployment for a grassroots organization, you can apply for a free social-impact responder account [here](https://www.ushahidi.com/plans/apply-for-free) after verifying that you meet the criteria.


## Getting Involved
There are many ways to get involved with Ushahidi, and some of them are great even for first time contributors. If you never contributed to Open Source Software before, or need more guidance doing it, please jump in our gitter channel with a clear description of what you are trying to do, and someone in there will try to help you.
These are some ways to get involved:

- **Documentation**: if you find an area of the Ushahidi platform that could use better docs, we would love to hear from you in an issue, and would be seriously excited if you send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/compare). This is a great way to get involved even if you are not technical or just have a passion to make information more available and clear to everyone.
- **Report a bug**: If you found an issue/bug, please report it [here](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/issues). Someone on the team will jump in to check it, try to help, and prioritize it for future development depending on the issue type.
- **Fix a bug**: If you want to contribute a fix for a bug you or someone else found, we will be happy to review your PR and provide support.
- **Helping other users in the community**: you are welcome and encouraged to jump in and help other members of the community, either by responding to issues in github or jumping into our community channels to answer questions. 
- **New features**: our features are generally driven by our product and engineering team members, but if you have a great idea, or found a user need that we haven't covered, you are more than welcome to make a suggestion in the form of a github issue [here](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/issues), or reach out to Ushahidi staff in [gitter](https://gitter.im/ushahidi/Community)
