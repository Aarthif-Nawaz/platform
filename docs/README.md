### What is Ushahidi?

Ushahidi is an open source web application for information collection, visualization and interactive mapping. It helps you to collect info from: SMS, Twitter, RSS feeds, Email. It helps you to process that information, categorize it, geo-locate it and publish it on a map.

### A note for grassroots organizations

If you are starting a deployment for a grassroots organization, you can apply for a free social-impact responder account [here](https://www.ushahidi.com/plans/apply-for-free) after verifying that you meet the criteria.
